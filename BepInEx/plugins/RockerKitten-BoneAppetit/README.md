Each level of cooking skill adds a 1% chance to craft an additional consumable. after lvl 25, your total cooking level is divided by 4 and the results is the % chance to crafted a 2nd additional consumable.
			e.g. At level 100, there is a 100% chance to craft an additional consumable and 25% chance to craft a 2nd additional consumable on top of that. At level 100 a food that crafts in stacks of x5, if lucky could output 7 total items.

Huge thanks to zarboz, GraveBear, and plumga for helping me get going, setting me up, and encouraging me the whole way! This mod wouldn't exist without them.
Also a big thanks to my "players" on my server (my husband and our good friend) Itsmesds, and JaxomFaux who've helped with ideas and balance from the start. (Bone Appetit's name came from us haning out when itmesds said how about "bone appetit" and it stuck)
