# Dual Wield

Twice the weapons, twice the fun. Lets you dual wield axes, clubs, knives and swords.

Some hints:
- Both weapons have to be the same weapon type. You cannot dual wield a mace and an axe, for example.
- You really cannot dual wield spears.
- Also adds a special attack for dual wielding axes.
- Starting out, your damage will be low, because you have to level the dual wielding skills for each weapon.
- Damage, attack speed and stamina consumption can be configured in the settings.
- For multiplayer servers, make sure to install this mod on the server as well, to enforce the servers configuration.
